# Using Machine Learning Algorithm

### Introduction

This task was done to become familiar with EDA and use Machine Learning Algorithms for classification problems. The selected dataset was about Autistic Spectrum Disorder. The dataset contains information on various medical tests of patients and the information that if they suffer from that disease or not. From the provided data we have to make a classification model to predict whether any person is suffering from the disease. At first for understanding the dataset we have to do various EDA techniques and make the dataset suitable to train the classification model.

### Implementation

In this task, we use libraries like

- pandas: To read the dataset into a data frame. To know a basic understanding of the dataset, its distribution, null values, statistic value of numeric data, and correlation between the numeric data.
To install this library type the following on the terminal

```python
pip install pandas
```

- matplotlib and seaborn: Used for data visualization. Bar charts, histograms, box plots, and heat maps were used to understand data in more effective ways.
To install this library type the following on the terminal

```python
pip install matplotlib seaborm
```

- sklearn: Use for preprocessing the data like normalization and for model selection and metrics to evaluate the model.
To install this library type the following on the terminal

```python
pip install sklearn
```

### Take ways

- EDA process concepts
- Important libraries used for EDA and classification Algorithm
- Topics like encoding especially Normalization.
