# Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

### Introduction

This task was done to provide a basic concept of the EDA process. The selected dataset was about Covid in CSV format. The provided dataset contains information about the people who come to check whether they were suffering from Covid or not. It contains some personal information and medical condition information which may be the cause of suffering from Covid.

### Implementation

In this task, we use libraries like

- pandas: To read the dataset into a data frame. To know a basic understanding of the dataset, its distribution, null values, statistic value of numeric data, and correlation between the numeric data.
To install this library type the following on the terminal

```python
pip install pandas
```

- numpy: To select different age groups based on the Age column
To install this library type the following on the terminal

```python
pip install numpy
```

- matplotlib: Used for data visualization. Bar charts, pie charts, and bar plots were used to understand data in more effective ways.
To install this library type the following on the terminal

```python
pip install matplotlib
```

- category_encoders: Used to get one hot encoding. One hot encoding is applied for various columns like gender, Region, and many more to understand how it works.
To install this library type the following on the terminal

```python
pip install category_encoders
```

### Takeaways

- EDA process concepts
- Important libraries used for EDA
- Topics like encoding especially One Hot Encoding.
